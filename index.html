          I enjoy making video games in my free time, as well as working on other

              I’m an aspiring developer from the Czech Republic, primarily focused
              on game development, with a growing interest in cybersecurity. I
              work with C, C#, GML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python,

              I took part in the first year of the StreamAlly Game Jam with a
              small team of friends and classmates. Together, we created the
              game

        <h2>Why I started with game development</h2>
        <p>
          Games have fascinated me from the very beginning. At first, I only
          played them, but over time I realized that creating games is far more
          fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with game development when I was 12 years old, and it has
          kept me hooked ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mainly use GameMaker because of its simplicity, which is what allowed
          me to get started at such a young age.
